- **Introduction**

*The main goal of this document is to keep track of the practical hands-on work experience and lab challenges you will complete throughout the program. By doing so, at the end of the program, you will have a great portfolio that you can use for evidence of your practical skills, and you can also come back for review whenever needed. This evidence is essential in the long run and keeps you on track with the time you will spend on your career upgrade process.
